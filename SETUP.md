# Setup — bootstrapping a new app from this template

This is the one-time setup you do after using the template to create a new
repo. After this is done, every `git push origin main` auto-deploys to Fly.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated: `gh auth status`
- `flyctl` installed and authenticated: `~/.fly/bin/flyctl auth whoami`
- Cloudflare account with `griffith-pse.com` DNS zone

## 1. Create the repo from this template

Either use the GitHub UI's "Use this template" button on this repo's page,
or via CLI:

```bash
APP_SLUG=pinch-analysis           # short, lowercase, hyphenated
APP_TITLE="Pinch Analysis"        # human-readable display name
APP_TAGLINE="Heat-integration via the pinch design method"

gh repo create devin-griff/$APP_SLUG \
    --template devin-griff/griffith-pse-app-template \
    --private \
    --clone

cd $APP_SLUG
```

## 2. Substitute placeholders

Replace `plant-layout`, `Plant Layout`, `griffith-pse-plant-layout`, and `Process plant layout via GDP — minimize plant size + pipe costs` in
every text file (including the Dockerfile and fly.toml):

```bash
find . -type f \( -name '*.py' -o -name '*.md' -o -name '*.toml' -o -name 'Dockerfile' \) \
    -exec sed -i \
    "s|plant-layout|$APP_SLUG|g; \
     s|Plant Layout|$APP_TITLE|g; \
     s|griffith-pse-plant-layout|griffith-pse-$APP_SLUG|g; \
     s|Process plant layout via GDP — minimize plant size + pipe costs|$APP_TAGLINE|g" {} +
```

Sanity check — no placeholders left:
```bash
grep -rn '<APP_' . --include='*.py' --include='*.md' --include='*.toml' --include='Dockerfile' || echo "all substituted"
```

## 3. Add Python dependencies

Edit `requirements.txt`. Pure-pip libraries — `pyomo`, `pyomo-ripopt`,
`scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `plotly`, `altair`, `networkx`, `cvxpy`, `openai`,
`anthropic`, etc. — just go on a line each.

If you need a system library (GLPK solver binary, GraphViz, FFmpeg, etc.),
uncomment the matching block in the `Dockerfile`.

### Document the system deps in the README

If your app uses a system-binary solver, add the install instructions to the
README's "Run locally" section so anyone cloning the repo can actually run it.
Two patterns to copy from existing apps:

- **GLPK** (Knapsack, Diet) — short block listing `apt-get install glpk-utils`
  and `brew install glpk`.
- **rIPOPT** (Quad-tank) — note that the `pyomo-ripopt` wheel bundles the
  solver binary, so no separate install is needed.

For pure-Python solvers (scipy, scikit-learn, HiGHS via `highspy`), the
boilerplate `pip install -r requirements.txt && streamlit run app.py` is
sufficient — no extra README copy needed.

### Sidebar vs. no sidebar

`app.py` ships with the home-link logo wired up via `st.markdown` (the
sidebarless pattern used by Knapsack and Diet). If your app uses a sidebar
for set-then-solve workflows (the quad-tank pattern), swap the call for
`st.sidebar.markdown` — see the comment block above the call.

The sidebarless variant pins the logo to the viewport's top-left corner via
`position: fixed`. The sidebar variant (commented out in the CSS block)
drops the logo into the sidebar's flow via `display: block` so it sits at
the top of the sidebar and scrolls with the rest of the controls. Pick the
variant that matches your `markdown` call.

> **Tip — you can push to GitHub before the deploy is set up.** The
> deploy workflow checks for `FLY_API_TOKEN` and exits cleanly when the
> secret is missing, so iterating on `app.py` and committing while you
> figure out the deploy story produces clean no-op runs (no email noise).
> Steps 4–7 below are still required before the first real deploy.

## 4. Create the Fly app

```bash
~/.fly/bin/flyctl apps create griffith-pse-$APP_SLUG
```

## 5. Issue a deploy token + add as GitHub secret (one pipe)

The token must NEVER pass through chat or shell history. Use this pipe so
it goes straight from `flyctl` stdout into `gh` stdin:

```bash
~/.fly/bin/flyctl tokens create deploy -a griffith-pse-$APP_SLUG --name github-actions \
    | gh secret set FLY_API_TOKEN --repo devin-griff/$APP_SLUG
```

Verify the secret was set:
```bash
gh secret list --repo devin-griff/$APP_SLUG
```

## 6. Add Cloudflare DNS records for the subdomain

In the Cloudflare dashboard for `griffith-pse.com`:

- Type **A**, name `plant-layout`, value `66.241.124.X` (Fly's edge — get the
  exact IP from `flyctl certs add` below; often the same IP used by other
  apps in your org)
- Type **AAAA**, name `plant-layout`, value `2a09:8280:1::112:XXXX:0`
- **Both records must be DNS-only (gray cloud)**, not Proxied. Streamlit's
  WebSocket connections won't survive Cloudflare's proxy on Fly origins.

## 7. Issue the SSL cert via Fly

```bash
~/.fly/bin/flyctl certs add $APP_SLUG.griffith-pse.com -a griffith-pse-$APP_SLUG
```

Fly responds with the recommended A/AAAA values — paste those into Cloudflare
if you didn't already in step 6. Cert validation takes 30–60 s once DNS resolves.

## 8. First deploy + commit the substituted template

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Bootstrap from template"
git push origin main
```

This triggers GitHub Actions which runs `flyctl deploy --remote-only`. About
2–3 minutes from push to live at `https://$APP_SLUG.griffith-pse.com`.

## 9. (Optional) Add a card to the Quarto site

On the `griffith-pse-site` repo's `main` branch, add a new entry to
`index.qmd` under "Featured demos". The card is a clickable screenshot
that launches the app — matches the existing card pattern on the home page:

```markdown
::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
[![](images/plant-layout.png){.app-screenshot fig-alt="Plant Layout — click to launch"}](https://plant-layout.griffith-pse.com){.app-card-link target="_blank"}

### Plant Layout

<short description of what the app does>
:::
```

You'll need to drop a screenshot of the app at `griffith-pse-site/images/plant-layout.png`
(21:10 aspect ratio crops cleanly into the card grid). Push the site repo
→ Cloudflare Pages rebuilds in ~30 s.

---

## Future-app extension hints

### AI / LLM apps (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Set the API key as a Fly secret — it's mounted as an env var at runtime,
never committed to the repo:

```bash
~/.fly/bin/flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... -a griffith-pse-$APP_SLUG
```

Read in the app via `os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]` (or `st.secrets` if you
prefer Streamlit's wrapper). For local development, use a `.env` file (and
add `.env` to `.gitignore`).

### Heavier compute

Bump the machine size in `fly.toml` `[[vm]]` block. See the comments there
for options. Cost scales linearly with size; auto-stop still keeps idle
cost at $0.

**When you change the machine size, also update the README's `## Deployment`
section** — both the **Machine** bullet (size + RAM) and the **Cost ceiling**
number. The default block in this template assumes `shared-cpu-1x` / 1 GB →
~$3.89/mo ceiling. If you bump to `shared-cpu-2x` / 2 GB, the ceiling is
~$7.78/mo; for `performance-1x` / 4 GB, ~$23/mo. Look up the current rate
at https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/ and refresh the footnote date.

### GPU workloads

Fly supports GPU machines (`a10`, `a100`). They require a CUDA-enabled base
image and a different Dockerfile entirely. This template targets CPU; you'd
fork it for GPU work.

### Persistent state (DB, file uploads, user history)

Add a `[mounts]` block to `fly.toml` and create a Fly volume:
```bash
flyctl volumes create data --size 1 -a griffith-pse-$APP_SLUG
```
Then in `fly.toml`:
```toml
[[mounts]]
  source = "data"
  destination = "/data"
```
SQLite at `/data/app.db` is the simplest pattern. For Postgres, use a
separate Fly Postgres app + connection string.

### Commercial solvers (Gurobi, CPLEX)

License files mount via `fly secrets`. Dockerfile fetches at startup. Out
of scope for this template, but the pattern is documented in Fly's docs.
